# Object-Detection

This program uses Open CV library to detect objects in any image. It shows a bounded box and the probability of the class of the object detected.

It uses an algorithm known as Single Shot Detector (SSD) originally developed by Google and a neural network known as MobileNet, also developed by Google.

In this project, we use an already-trained model known as MobileNet SSD which is trained on the COCO dataset (Common Objects in Context). It can detect 20 objects in images including airplanes, bicycles, birds, boats, bottles, buses, cars, cats, chairs, cows, dining tables, dogs, horses, motorbikes, people, potted plants, sheep, sofas, trains, and tv monitors.
